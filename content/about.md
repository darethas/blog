Hi, I am Dimitrios. I am American with strong Greek roots, [Orthodox](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Introduction_to_Orthodox_Christianity), father of two wonderful children, and husband to the woman of my dreams. I am a software engineer but more fundamentally a lifelong learner. Currently, my talents reside in South Carolina at a humble little startup called Red Ventures. I am the youngest son of two wonderful people. My Baba had the classic "came to America with 13 dollars in my pocket" story.

"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is about 90% accurate about my life, minus two things. We don't spray windex on _everything_ (almost everything), and we don't have a Parthenon themed garage.

I knew I wanted to be a software developer at the ripe age of seven, when I was serving my oldest brother sodas and appetizers in hopes of convincing him to let me use the computer for an hour most nights. I remember when my mom brought home a top of the line Packard Bell desktop PC with an Intel i386 processor. It costed \$2,500 in 1992 and ran Windows 3.1. 3D graphics were all the rage and I remember playing this weird game where you were a guy on a cruise ship.

Well, that, and a lot of Sim Tower and AOL chat rooms. I remember being in a "guild" and this guy had built out a cool website for the guild. I wanted to know how to do that. He told me how he did it. Something called Perl and CGI. I read the Perl 5 manual. "What in the heck is a scalar?" I thought. A couple years later I was trying this cool thing out called "Java" and the rest is history.
