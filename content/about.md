Hi, I am Dimitrios, a father of one absolutely joy of a daughter, and husband to the woman of my dreams. I am a software engineer. Currently, my talents reside in South Carolina at a humble little startup called Red Ventures. I am the youngest son of two wonderful people. My "Baba" (may his memory be eternal) had the classic "came to America with 13 dollars in my pocket" story.

"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is about 90% accurate about my life, minus two things. We don't spray windex on _everything_ (almost everything), and we don't have a Parthenon themed garage, although we would if my dad could have afforded it. Although I was born here, I am pretty sure my mom taught me how to speak Greek first.

I knew I wanted to be a software developer at the ripe age of seven, when I was serving my oldest brother sodas and appetizers in hopes of convincing him to let me use the computer for an hour most nights. I remember when my mom brought home a top of the line Packard Bell desktop PC with an Intel i386 processor. It costed \$2,500 in 1992 and ran Windows 3.1. 3D graphics were all the rage and I remember playing this weird game where you were a guy on a cruise ship trying to hit on women.

Well, that, and a lot of Sim Tower and AOL chat rooms. I remember being in a "guild" and this guy had built out a cool website for the guild. I wanted to know how to do that. He told me how he did it. Something called Perl and CGI. I read the Perl 5 manual. "What in the heck is a scalar?" I thought. A couple years later I was trying this cool thing out called "Java" and the rest is history.

Finally, I am an [Orthodox Christian](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Introduction_to_Orthodox_Christianity). After teetering between agnosticism and atheism in my late high school to college days, absorbing all the Richard Dawkins-esque edgy "everything is Christianity's fault" memelording, (I certainly was a functional atheist), and spending unfortunately a little bit too more time believing in the end of the world in 2012, I was prostheyltized by a cult, and rediscovered my Orthodox roots. It didn't help that growing up, a lot of Greek Orthodox are more culturally Orthodox than actually Orthodox, as in it's just a thing they are proud of because of it's "greekness". Either way, I try not to worry about what others are doing and focus on the plank in my eye first, and since there is a high probability I'll spend the remainder of my life trying to take that out (save, removing the eye completely). It's probably a good default mindset. Ton's of pop psychology books talk about it, so you know there must be some truth to it.
